How to deal with ALMOST burnout when you just took a two-week vacation
- Sometimes you feel like you need a vacation and then get back from one and feel like you need a vacation from the vacation
- When you have unlimited PTO, it means much of time that people don’t know how many days to take off
- Is PTO really the answer to burning out?
- Seems like the only thing that helps is thinking about long term goals. Can help avoid the existential dread
- Been experimenting with “focus days”. You have to deal with so much context, messages, alerts, etc. So instead you get to block that out for a whole day and only work on one thing. Almost like PTO, but instead you work on specific stuff.
- Try to build the relaxation into your day instead of trying to only relax when you’re on vacation

Do I just manage configs until I die or does this get exciting again at some point?
- Feels like I pretty consistently finding the same solutions to the same problems, and its always picking an open source tool and managing the configurations. It isn’t very stimulating
- Everything is just plumbing
- On the other hand I yearn for a boring job because having to deal with people problems is draining
- When I think of popular people in DevOps space, their careers sound exciting and full of building new things…but that seems unattainable when everything is just changing yaml files
- Sounds like you’re describing toil, and organizations have a lot of it

What even is engineering?
- Got started in help desk in a data center. Doubled pay by jumping to an “engineering” titled job, but the work was all toil. People seem to think that help tech work isn’t engineering
- If you take it out of the software context, some people might think of it like the people who design the cars versus the mechanic who fixes it?
- Engineering isn’t something that you learn by reading books, its something that you apply by working on stuff
- Seems like engineers can be pretentious jerks, and look down upon anyone who comes from a support background
- Its classicism!
- Support folk should be good at engineering! They have to troubleshoot, find their way in a novel situation and then automate the solution!
- With the analogy of the mechanic and the mechanical engineer who builds the car, it seems like there could be a middle ground where the mechanic knows the car so well that they could build one on their own
- Engineering is the application of science/math etc to solve problems
