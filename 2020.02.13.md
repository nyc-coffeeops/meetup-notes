Office VPN
- As soon as you have internal tools you’re hitting via http, time to start thinking about a VPN
- WireGuard
- RoadWarrior
- Googles IAP

How “deep” is DevOps
- feel like a lot of stuff that we work on is just the same stuff. Not seeing the really intense stuff. What kind of org do you see that in?
- In small orgs, can feel more like a help desk. Not “creating” or solving the “big” problems
- Need an org large enough to take care of the fundamentals so you can have specialists

Auto apply Terraform
- be careful about running plan and apply as separate steps
- Definitely output your plan to a file and do apply from that file
- Terraform Cloud?

Workload Identities
- working with accessing cloud apis from within kubernetes
- Curious as to how other people solve these problems
- Can apply roles to nodes in GCP, but not pods necessarily
- Should probably just inject service account credentials, since you need to support multi cloud

Learning Vim
- installed VSCode Vim extension
- Played Vim Adventures free tier
- Only know the basic movement. How to learn more?
- Force yourself to not use your mouse
- Every time you think there’s a better way to do something, just google it and force yourself to do it
- Easy motion plugin. Puts a one or two key display in front of each word and takes you there when you press it
- Vim Golf

GitHub CLI
- Very underwhelmed
- Isn’t Hub already a thing
- So far it only does issues and PR?
- Everybody just has a browser tab open to GitHub 

Getting gooder faster
- background: seems like experience helps, but there are many people with lots of experience who aren’t good. What’s the secret sauce?
- Many times, personal goals don’t line up with business goals, so it can be hard to learn new things and grow
- Very easy to hit decision paralysis and worry about doing the right thing so much that you don’t do anything at all
-
