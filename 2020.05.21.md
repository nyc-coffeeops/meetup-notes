Epiphanies
- Sharing this from my company —> https://ins1ghts.ns1.com/ - free! June 11th - a digital gathering of industry leaders in NetOps, DevOps, and application delivery

Talk about pizza arbitrage
- Doordash would scrape restaurants websites to build menus that you can order from, but prices were wrong
- So restaurants could order from themselves at a reduced price, and door dash would pay the restaurant full price
- Profit
- Doordash doesn’t care because they just want to acquire customers
- Customer acquisition at all costs has been a successful business strategy, but has been struggling recently
- Its always Softbank with the wild investments. How do they have so much money???
- What about the ethics of this?
- Its pretty shady to say the least

The new normal: what does successful work from home look like?
- If everybody is working from home, as a business are you responsible for their productive home work environment? Should you buy them equipment, or just give them cash?
- To hire international and get a green card you have to prove that you can’t hire internally first
- There might be some legal considerations about repetitive stress issues when working from home, if you can’t provide a good work environment
- Definitely equally or more productive when working from home
- NYC has a negative growth of full time residents

Future of the NY tech scene
- Barrier to entry for startups might have been removed if they don’t have to have an office space
- Other people will want the the NY lifestyle, if people leave, others will fill in
- Wouldn’t be amazing if teachers and firefighters etc could actually afford to live in the neighborhoods they serve
- Only half joking about looking at houses in our hometowns or in much cheaper areas
- A lot of businesses are in NY or SF because that’s where the talent and the business is. If that changes, maybe business location changes
- Will be interesting to see if salaries are impacted with more and more people being remote. If you don’t have to pay a NY salary, maybe you won’t
- Hiring remote opens up the candidates to a much larger pool
- How much of dev salaries is paying for talent versus paying for location

Favorite k8s vendors
- So…kubernetes
- Want to be deploying k8s on premises to host a new application, looking at the enterprise offerings
- Why kube?
- If you’re just starting the containerization journey, even if you get k8s going, you might not be able to run your apps in it since they won’t be containerized yet
- Going commercial helps since you might have support from them in adopting containerization
- Only ever heard good things about Rancher
- Google Cloud Anthos for supporting enterprise k8s with on premises or hybrid
- Maybe you don’t need kubernetes? (https://endler.dev/2019/maybe-you-dont-need-kubernetes/)
- Kubernetes failure stories (https://github.com/hjacobs/kubernetes-failure-stories)
- Mentioned local testing, you can just use Kubernetes in Docker (aka KinD), allows you spin up k8s locally easily inside docker

Keeping docs up to date/Right level of documentation/How to get people to read the docs you spend so much time creating
- Spend lots of time creating docs, actually have a lot of docs, but nobody reads them! Why???
- We’ve been conditioned to assume that docs either don’t exist, or don’t contain the info we need, so we don’t even look
- Too many places where you _could_ find docs, so nobody knows where to look
- Should you document things that people aren’t asking about? It won’t be up to date if nobody is constantly asking and refreshing the docs
- Bad or out of date docs can be worse than no documentation at all
- Make a warning that docs are “point in time”. Have to consider _when_ the docs were written
- Have to consider why you are doing docs. What do you value? If you only create docs to help new hires, that might not be the right motivation
